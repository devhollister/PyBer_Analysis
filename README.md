# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 

The following is an analysis of transaction data for the ride-share company PyBer. Data from a total of 2,375 rides was categorized by whether the transaction occured in a rural, suburban, or urban city. This new analysis builds upon previous knowledge gained through an analysis of the measures of central tendencies of data by city type and the percent of total fares, total rides, and total drivers by city type. 

## Results: 

The total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares, average ride per fare, and average fare per driver for each of the three city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) are shown in the chart below:

It can be seen that the majority of rides (1,625) and the largest total fares ($39,854.38) occurred in urban settings, where there are also many more drivers (2,405). Suburban cities saw the second highest number of rides (625), total fares ($19,356.33), and number of drivers (490), with rural cities having significantly lower numbers across all categories (125 rides, $4,327.93 total fares, 78 drivers). When it comes to the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, the opposite is true: average fare per ride and driver were lowest in urban cities ($24.53 and $16.57, respectively) and highest in rural cities($34.62 and $55.49). 

When weekly ride fares are analyzed by city type specifically from Jan-April of 2019 (displayed below), it is shown that total ride fares generally followed the same pattern from week to week, with fares peaking at the end of February for all city types. Indeed some weeks are exceptions, especially at the start of January and end of April. It can also be seen that there are no weeks in which rural fares exceeded suburban or urban fares, and similarly there are no weeks in which suburban fares exceeded urban fares.
